A simple top down shooter with some basic pixel art. Its my first project trying out Godot.

The game is made using Godot's C# extension. Coded using .NET 9 in Godot 4.4

The game currently is being actively developed as i get familiar with Godot's tools, so far these are the features:
1. WASD movement
2. Health and Ammo management
3. Enemy spawning and damage
